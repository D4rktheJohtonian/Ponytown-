I'm bored, so I decided to make this. ✨

I like writing paragraphs quite a lot. (digitally only. My wrist broke if traditionally).

### Anyways, let's just get into the point.

I usually play Ponytown if I'm bored (besides Pokémon TCGP, obviously).

You might even see me in the server for hours! 😁

*I'm either in the safe server under a tree near a bench, on a cliff left near the spawn point. In Indonesian server, I usually wandering around in quiet place.*

I always use Pokémon characters as my pony. I often use Red, Ethan, and Silver. ❤️💛

My ponies has basic colouring but abstract shading. I use light colour as the outline shading lol.
