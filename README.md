### How to found me,

Usually play Ponytown if I'm bored (besides Pokémon TCGP, obviously).

You might even see me in the server for hours! 😁

I'm online most of the time except for 12 am to 7 am. (Tho sometimes you might see me online at 12 am to 2 am).

Oh, and my timezone is UTC+7 (I think-)

*I'm either in the safe server near the FNF area and TMC/MP area. In Indonesian server, I usually wandering around in quiet place.*

I usually use Pokémon, God of War, or SAW characters as my pony. I often use Red, Ethan, Hermes, and William. ❤️💛

My ponies has basic colouring but abstract shading. I use light colour as the outline shading lol.
