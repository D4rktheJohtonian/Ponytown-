### How to find me.

Usually play Ponytown if I'm bored (besides Pokémon TCGP, obviously).

You might even see me in the server for hours! 😁

I'm online most of the time except for 12 am to 7 am. (Tho sometimes you might see me online at 12 am to 2 am).

Oh, and my timezone is UTC+7 (I think-)

*I'm either in the safe server near the FNF area and TMC/MP area. In Indonesian server, I usually wandering around in quiet place.*

I don't mind C+H at all, as long as you don't cover me. Feel free to be close near me! W2i pref cause I'm usually afk/making skins.

I use Ethan ALOT, because there's huge possibility that I might kin him! (Also if you're one of my friend and also kin him, I'm really sorry I swear 🙏🏼).

My ponies has basic colouring but abstract shading. I use light colour as the outline shading lol.
